The Odin Project is an open-source community dedicated to providing the best information sources to take you from zero to a full-stack developer.

In this unit, we’ll learn about how the web works and start thinking about the basics of computer and web programming.

Each of the following sections and lessons represents essential baseline knowledge. Even if you have no intention of becoming a web developer yourself, this material should help you gain a useful understanding of the moving parts involved in creating and serving content on the web.

We will start by getting familiar with the internet and your own computer. Next, we’ll work on setting up a development environment and learning about Git and GitHub. Then, we’ll go over the basics of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript before stepping into the back end with a brief foray that covers the basic concepts of back-end technologies.

By the end of this unit, you should not only understand how the web works but also be able to identify and differentiate between all the technologies that you will use to build your own web applications. You will be able to build a basic webpage, style it, and add minor elements of interactivity while working comfortably from the command line.

This section intentionally covers a very broad range of topics. It’s silly to go diving straight into server-side programming without having a context for what it is and why it’s useful (and why you should learn it!).

##### How it works

This curriculum works by pulling together the best content from across the internet for learning a particular topic. In each lesson, we’ll introduce the topic and try to provide some useful context before pointing you to external resources made by others.

Most lessons will contain questions that you should be able to answer before moving on. Some of the lessons will ask you to complete exercises. In addition, we provide several projects throughout the curriculum to help you grow your understanding by actually building things.

Try not to think of The Odin Project, or programming, as a class in school. It’s not material you learn all at once to take a test, and then pass or fail. You can think of it as a snowball. You, yourself, are a snowball. You’re rolling down a hill full of snow; the further you roll, the more snow will stick to you. Sure, snow will also fall off you, and you’ll forget things often, but that’s just part of the process. Don’t be scared if you get to a project and you feel like you haven’t retained or memorized anything. That’s natural and happens to everyone. The information will come back to you as you start solving your problems one at a time, relying on Google and the Odin Community for help.

##### What comes next
Once you’ve completed this course, you should feel comfortable with the building blocks of web programming but itching to dig deeper. Though we spend a fair bit of time digging into each of the major topics in this course, it’s really just a taste of what comes next (and all the cool stuff you can do with it).

The last lesson of this course will give you an opportunity to choose between a Full Stack JavaScript and Full Stack Rails path, both of which are designed to take the foundation built in this course and build it into an applied understanding of the material. Each path will focus on taking these raw building blocks and honing them into a highly functional skillset.

The Odin Project is maintained by professionals. We have chosen some of the best resources available and curated a guide on how to go through them. If there are no good resources, we write our own. With that said, know that **everything** in the curriculum is intentionally included and vital for you to become a successful programmer.

As you move forward in the curriculum, each portion is built on everything that came before it, so skipping things will create pockets of non-understanding in your knowledge that start to affect your ability to solve problems and understand the task at hand.

Additional resources are the only thing that is considered optional unless explicitly stated. These are here in case you feel like you need or want to dive deeper into a topic to get a better understanding.

The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
